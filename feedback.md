Your submission was great. It was very detailed and it looks like you guys are on the right track. Keep up the good work on that end.

Some sidenotes:

**Trello:** Your trello activity has been lacking lately.

**Meeting Notes:** Your meeting notes are pretty good. Everyone's tasks are clear.

**Github Activity:** The Github activity has been lacking lately it seems as well. I recommend working on the app and updating Github as often as you can. Be sure that everyone is committing so it's easier to see who is contributing for when it comes time to determining final grades.

I think you all did a pretty good job on this. While I was hoping for possibly a little more detail in the screen-by-screen section, the graphics for each screen were great. 

Your meeting notes were great. They were nicely detailed and clearly showed  everyones level of contribution to the project.

It looks like you're going in the right direction so far, so keep it up.

I think the idea has potential. There have a been a few ideas similar to this that I've seen over the last 3 years, and none of them are around still. Their problem, I think, was their user experience that their web apps offered. They weren't designed nicely. I think as long as you make sure your implementation works and make sure it's an enjoyable experience using the app, this could turn out to be something people actually use. 

To make something like Front-End design easier, while allowing you to achieve a modern, responsive, web layout, I'd recommend checking out: 
http//:getbootstrap.com 

It's a CSS framework that gives a lot of HTML tags a certain styling (which you can preview on their website), so you don't have style. One thing I will note though about Bootstrap: make sure you don't overuse div tags. It can be very easy to get caught up with making div tags everywhere and adding classes to them, but doing that convolutes the code and makes it harder to follow. The point of HTML is structure.

WHAT YOU WERE MISSING: Research on other similar apps was missing from this project.

The proposal seems fine and the presentation slides were good. Your proposal could've been more detailed, but it was good enough overall. So, thumbs up; you've been fully funded!

Thumbs up! You guys included everything needed in the profile. The idea itself isn't necessarily anything new, but I think there's a lot of potential. If it's done well, the course project could turn into something bigger. There's been a few people at UMass over the last few years that have tried variations of this idea and it looks like none of them got it right. What makes this idea interesting is the ability to see the quality of the event, whether people are having a good time or not. Im curious to see how you guys develop this and looking forward to what it might look like.

You guys seem like you're on the right track so far. Your meeting notes are pretty good as well. I noticed there have been cards added to the Trello board, so it's good to see you've been using that. 

Be sure to keep using Trello and good job!
