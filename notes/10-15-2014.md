** Project 3 Second Meeting **

October 15, 2014

Paricipants: All in person at 6th floor of Du Bois
- Stephen Collins
- Steven Jones
- Derek Costigan
- Ariel Reches
- Dylan Terry
- Ryan Herlihy

Discussion highlights:
- We came to the conclusion that we are not going to make a 'list' interface that shows the top pinns in the user's given radius. We feel that it would take away from the purpose of the web app. Instead, when a user zooms out, the more popular pinns will stay visible, while the less popular ones will disapear.
- Thought of realistic scenerios for spam and when pinns will disapear.
- Discussed how many posts a user will get a day. We will be able to track a user through IP addresses and/or cookies.
