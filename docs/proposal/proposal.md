## Problem Statement

On any given day, there are people hosting events and people looking for things to do. These two groups of people should be able to help each other; the event hosts want to populate their events and event-goers want to populate them. The problem is, there is no way to broadcast events (and the feedback coming from those events) to the general, event-seeking, public in your area.  This isn’t only a problem for hosts who want as many people as possible to know about their rad bake sale/ glow-stick rave for polar bear awareness, but for the bored and skeptical general public as well, who wasn’t aware there was such a rad bake sale/glow-stick rave going on. 

This sort of problem came up all the time in our courses:
-In an Alternative Spring Break course we wanted to fundraise by having a huge party, but 
-In Sociology 240 we were required to attend sociology presentations. It was difficult to keep track of when and where talks were being given.

## Product Description

PinndIt is the social event broadcasting app where users can drop a Pinn at the location of an event. Users are able to view this on a map interface where each Pinn represents an event. Users at the location are able to “upvote” or “downvote” each pin depending on the experience of the event. This gives prospective event attendees an idea of if they are interested in going to the event. For example if Sigma Phi Epsilon has a barbecue to raise money for cancer research, someone can drop a Pinn at the event and people can vote on if the event is enjoyable.


## Timeline

Week 3-5
Create map interface, drop pins and view others' pins
