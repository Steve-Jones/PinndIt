# Project Overview

PinndIt is the social event broadcasting app where users can drop a Pinn at the location of an event. Users are able to view this on a map interface where each Pinn represents an event. Users at the location are able to “upvote” or “downvote” each pin depending on the experience of the event. This gives prospective event attendees an idea of if they are interested in going to the event. For example if Sigma Phi Epsilon has a barbecue to raise money for cancer research, someone can drop a Pinn at the event and people can vote on if the event is enjoyable.

# Original Proposal

We wrote a proposal consisting of an introduction to the team, the problem statement, a description of the product, a timeline and a funding outlook. This is all in the  proposal.md 

# Design Specification

The design specification is the listing of each of the components for our product and how they all interact with one another. It contains 
the outline for who is doing what in the project as well as what the project summary is. This is all in the dspec.md.

# Final Product

The instructions on how to set up the database is in database folder. There are README's to help with the setup. Otherwise the server is run with the standard express wwww.
The workable code is located in pinndit-app. Here is the link to our google drive: [link to our drive](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B0UfL9fz95t6Yk9CQUxRUWx3RmM&usp=sharing)
If functionality does not work as demonstrated try the cookie branch, it does not have the db, but works more reliably.
