# Project Overview

PinndIt is the social event broadcasting app where users can drop a Pinn at the location of an event. Users are able to view this on a map interface where each Pinn represents an event. Users at the location are able to “upvote” or “downvote” each pin depending on the experience of the event. This gives prospective event attendees an idea of if they are interested in going to the event. For example if Sigma Phi Epsilon has a barbecue to raise money for cancer research, someone can drop a Pinn at the event and people can vote on if the event is enjoyable.
